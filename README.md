<p>
I created another agent called John Doe and I gave him the role of support. I did not give him the ability to create or delete users, he only has limited access to tickets that are assigned to him. Janet doe on the other hand has full access because she has been assigned System Administrative.

I created four help topics with different priority levels. I am going to assign these help topics to the users I created in the next project that I do. This is the last part of this project.
